# Xonacra
Cards vs Castles, a single-player remake of multiplayer Arcanox, a game for Android that is no longer playable

You can find Arcanox.apk at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.juhugames.arcanox (at least in chrome) but once installed, it can't find the server to connect to the game.

## Tools
The following tools are provided, which use Arcanox.apk as a skin, of sorts:
* [Map](https://quasic.github.io/Xonacra/map.html) let's you play with the dungeon map from the game.
* [pngassets](https://quasic.github.io/Xonacra/pngassets.html) shows all assets as described by atlas files, though its a bit buggy.
